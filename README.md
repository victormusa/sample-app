# sample-app
# Vagrant project with Nginx+php-fpm+Redis

# This app assumes you already have Vagrant + VirtualBox working environment

# only by performing "vagrant up" you will get a nginx, php-fpm and a redis server for session handling with also a automatic # # background task notification for getting a email if status change to something different than "up"

# Also theres a script called "1erejercicio.sh" that is a tool to get a "A" registry from domain and then check with that data # against an ip address or domain

# For next version we will start using variables so you can input the ipaddresses or hostname for example 

# Thanks for your attention and Enjoy
